The task for this week was to create a full stack application with React.js

User Stories
🐿️ As a user, I want to be able to create new posts and add them to the page
🐿️ As a user, I want to be able to assign a category to each post
🐿️ As a user, I want to be able to view all posts added on the page and the category they're in
🐿️ As a user, I want to be able to view all posts in a specific category by visiting a dedicated page for that category (Stretch Goal)
🐿️ As a user, I want to be able to add new categories (Stretch Goal)

Requirements
Make in the order:

Database (Supabase), 

Server (Express),

Client (React)

 ** Remember to create 2 folders in your project root. One named "server" and one named "client". **

🎯 Design a database schema with relationships between tables

🎯 Create a new application with a React client and an Express server
(again, remember the client and the server should be separate)

🎯 Seed the database with data. Either run your SQL queries in Supabase SQL Editor OR use a seed.js file. (if you use the Supabase editor, save the scripts you run in a file in your project, in case you need to rerun them, or we need to duplicate the project)

🎯 Create Express endpoints to handle requests so you can POST and GET the data appropriately for your application.

🎯 Create multiple pages using react-router-dom

🎯 Create a home page.
🎯 Create a page to show all the posts and use fetch to call your server to get your data.
🎯 Create a page where users can create new posts using a form.
Stretch Goals
🏹 Allow users to "Like" posts and increase the likes

🏹 Allow users to DELETE posts

🏹 Allow users to filter posts in a specific category. Use either a query string like /posts?category=education or a dedicated route for the categories at /posts/:categoryName.



REQUIREMENTS MET:
1) A user is able to view all posts, view posts by categories and also add a new post
2) A user is able to delete a post and the UI re-renders 

Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve? - i was able to achieve the basic requirements but i wasnt able to implement a like button/functionality...this would be something i can focus on in the future
